<h1>P5 experiences</h1>


<h2>Linepicture</h2>
<p>This experience load a picture and draw it with a sinusoid starting from the center and turning outward, the height and number of sinusoid based on brightness of the pixels behind.</p>

<h2>Linespaint</h2>
<p>This experience load a picture and draw over it with random vectors defined by the user, color of the vector being the average color behind the vector</p>

<h2>Neurocar</h2>
<p>cars using a neural network using genetic algorithm for evolution tries to find their way to the end, usually takes around 70 generations to finish</p>

<h2>Evolution</h2>
<p>evolution of the great wave of kanagawa using tesselation and genetic algorithm.

<h2>Tesselation</h2>
<p>Based on previous experience where I am a bit disapointed by the result of the genetic algorithm, I went with a simpler version where user can upload their images and decide the number of points</p>

<h2>Autonomous Tesselation</h2>
<p>Based on previous experience I asked myself what would happen if the triangles where on top of autonomous agents with a few rules (flee the mouse, move away from other points and stay away from the walls). You can click to add triangles.</p>

<h2>Tessel density</h2>
<p>I was not happy with the tesselation genetic algorithm that was converging and decided to go the old way and decide by myself where you need polygons. In this experience, I scan each pixel of the image and decide the probability to show a triangle based on the "darkness" of the pixel. You can test with your own images</p>
