			<h2>Tessel border</h2>
			<p>Continuing my quest to get the tessel where they should be, a friend told me it is not because it is blacker that it should need more tessels, it is more the rapid variation of color that requires more tessels, so I went for an edge detector and used <a href="https://fellipe.com/demos/lena-js/">Lena.js</a> that I adapted for my purpose (a new pixelate function)</p>
