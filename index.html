		<li id="tesselavatar">
			<div class="picture"></div>
			<h2>Tessel avatar</h2>
			<p>I have an idea of application and I would like to use avatars but I don t want the balnd avatar with the indefinite guy, I want something more colorful for those who did not set yet their own picture. I also wanted the avatar to be unique but always generated exactly the same way based on a provided text input. So I came with this solution based on tessel.</p>

		<li id="pointspaint">
			<div class="picture"></div>
			<h2>Points paint</h2>
			<p>I think I saw something similar on coding train but I don t remember exactly. It draws circles that grow until they touch their neighbour. The color is the one at the center of the circle.</p>

		</li>

		<li id="lines">
			<div class="picture"></div>
			<h2>Lines</h2>
			<p>I decide a point randomly and I check in 8 directions with line is the darkest and I draw this line</p>

		<li id="duplicated">
			<div class="picture"></div>
			<h2>Duplicated</h2>
			<p>A small game written in javascript where you control multiple users with same inputs</p>

		</li>
		
		<li id="tesselborder">
			<div class="picture"></div>
			<h2>Tessel border</h2>
			<p>Continuing my quest to get the tessel where they should be, a friend told me it is not because it is blacker that it should need more tessels, it is more the rapid variation of color that requires more tessels, so I went for an edge detector and used <a href="https://fellipe.com/demos/lena-js/">Lena.js</a> that I adapted for my purpose (a new pixelate function)</p>
